# Kubernetes on Azure using Terraform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lawrencegripper/azure-aks-terraform.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lawrencegripper/azure-aks-terraform)

> Warning: This template relies on two PR's which are not yet be released. We expect them to be available shortly:
    @jjcollinge: [AKS credentials export](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/pull/953) & @lawrencegripper: [Log Analytics Solution provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/pull/952)

This project aims to show a simple example of how you can setup a fully featured k8s cluster on Azure using terraform. 

## What does it create? 

The `main.tf` deploys a [`resourcegroup`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) in which an [`aks cluster`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/), [`log analytics workspace`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/), [`managed redis cache`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/redis-cache/) and a [`container monitoring`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-containers) solution are added.

Then the connection details from the `redis` and the `log analytics workspace` are injected into the Kuberentes cluster as `Secrets` and a `Deamonset` is created to host the `container monitoring solution agent`. 

## Using 

### Required Tooling

- Terraform
- Azure CLI
- Community Kubernetes provider [v1.0.7](https://github.com/sl1pm4t/terraform-provider-kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.0.7-custom)

*Note*: Currently the Hashicorp maintained k8s provider is missing some k8s resource types, such as Daemon-Sets, luckily there is a fork maintained with these additional resources. In future, once the [hashicorp provider is updated](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-kubernetes/pull/101), this requirement can be dropped. 

### Running

1. Login to the Azure CLI `az login`
2. Clone this repository and `cd` into the directory
2. Create a service principal for `az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment` [How-to here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-service-principal#pre-create-a-new-sp)
3. Create a `varaibles.tfvars` file and add your service principal `clientid` and `clientsecret` as variables. Also add an ssh key and username for logging into k8s agent nodes.

```hcl
client_id = "2f61810e-7f8d-49fd-8c0e-c4ffake51f9f"

client_secret = "57f8b670-012d-42b2-a0f8-c3fakee239ad"

linux_admin_username = ""

linux_admin_ssh_publickey = "ssh-rsa AAAasdfasdc2EasdfasdfAAABAQC+b42lMQef/l5D8c7kcNZNf6m37bdfITpUVcfakerFT/UAWAjym5rxda0PwdkasdfasdfasdfasdfVspDGCYWvHpa3M9UMM6cgdlq+R4ISif4W04yeOmjkRR5j9pcasdfasdfasdfW6PJcgw7IyWIWSONYCSNK6Tk5Yki3N+nAvIxU34+YxPTOpRw42w1AcuorsomethinglikethisnO15SGqFhNagUP/wV/18fvwENt3hsukiBmZ21aP8YqoFWuBg3 james@something"

```
5. Download the Kuberentes provider by running `boostrap_linux.sh` (or mac, windows)
4. Run `terraform init` then `terraform plan -var-file=variables.tfvars` to see what will be created... finally if it looks good run `terraform apply -var-file=variables.tfvars` to create your cluster

## Notes/FAQ

1. Why haven't you used `modules` to organize the template? We'd suggest using them but to keep things simple, and easy readable for those new to Terraform, we haven't included them. 

2. I receive the error `Error: kubernetes_daemonset.container_agent: Provider doesn't support resource: kubernetes_daemonset`: Delete the `.terraform` folder from the directory then make sure you have downloaded the community edition of the kubernetes provider and it is named correctly stored in the current directory. 
 
3. I receive the error `* provider.azurerm: No valid (unexpired) Azure CLI Auth Tokens found. Please run az login.`: Run any `az` command which talks to Azure and it will update the token. For example run `az group list` then retry the Terraform command.
